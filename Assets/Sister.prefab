  - What are you waiting for?
  - Mother would not like the idea of me climbing in a Ginkgo tree with a dress...
  - Go brother go!
  - ...
  - If you give me your pants I would not mind helping you collect fruits.
  - You can do it brother!
  - May the heavens bless this fight...
  - Beware of-- ACK! BIRDS!
  - Is that a squirrel??
  - This tree smells...
  - Ginkgo trees are renowed in China. Although, you'll usually see the male ones.
  - Where's China? Um, I suppose it's not surprising you haven't heard of it in this
    world...
  - Oh nothing!
  - Female trees are the smelly ones, but they're the only one who gives these fruits.
  - I heard the Church here values something completely different than what they're
    branded.
  - What is it? Uh, something about Thoma from Genshin Impact.
  - What's Genshin Impact? It's a game.
  - What type of game? A mobi-- A COLLECTING GAME.
  - Sorry sorry, I won't slander the church anymore.
  - May the goddess protect thee.
  - Not to be rude, but don't you have a job to do?
  - Hmph...
  - ...
  - ...
  - ...
  - Fine, I give up. I do love Thoma as much as the church does.
  - What else would you like to know?
  - What I think about the goddess? I hope that she will accept the offering to make
    our parents better.
  - What do I think about you? I'm glad you are my brother.
  - I see that there in no intention to stop talking to me.
  - Here, this is all I have. May the goddess accept it as an offering.
